Modern & green energy solutions
    ITER fusion reaction
        ITER is the largest fusion machine in the world
        It works by smashing hydrogen together at very high speeds casuing a fusion reaction that emits a lot of heat
        The same fusion reaction is happening in the suns core but the human made fusion reaction is getting 10 times wamer reaching tempreuates of 150,000,000 degrees Celsius 
        With countries all over the world contributing to the build & research to complete the machine (including denmark)
        With more than 60 years in the makings the ITER reactor is far from finished
    Nuclear reaction
        A nuclear reaction is close to a fission reaction but a difference process (fission)
        In a nuclear reactor atoms split apart by colliding with the radioactive substance (Uranium 235) 
        Releasing heat energy & byproduct atoms 
        Nuclear power plants are a effectively way of harvesting green & almost Co2 free energy
    Windmills & Solar panels
        Windmills & solar panels are a Co2 free energy producing invention
        However using this source of energy cannot stand alone as sometimes its not sunny or windy
        But this is a great green source of energy that we should expand the production of for a more sustainable energy production

Fossil fuels
    The issues with fossil fules such as coal, oil & gas is for example
    Operating a coal-fired power station emits 820 grams of Co2 for every kWh which is the highest Co2 emission out of all of the fuel types
    Oil rigs collects crude oil from the earth then it will be processed at oil refinery plants then vehicles consumes the refined product as a fuel type emitting huge quantities of Co2 this creates major issues with pollution
    Operating a gas-fired power station emits nitrogen oxides that creates smog that can cause respiratory health issues and long time exposure can cause chronic lung disease 
    Fossil represents 80% of the world's energy production this is a horrible solution for humans and especially the environment


Co2 emissions
    In 1900 roughly 2 billions tons of Co2 was emitted and in the year 2000 roughly 25 billions tons of Co2 was emitted thats over 10 times then what was emitted 100 years ago
    In 2021 denmark emitted roughly 30 million tons of Co2 thats 5000 tons of Co2 per citizen







80% of the world's energy production comes from fossil fuels such as gas, coal and oil

Uploading a 6 seconds video uses the same amount of energy as boiling 84 liters of water

The internet consumes 9% of the world's total energy and emits 2% of the world's total Co2 consumption
Thats more then the worlds combined flight Co2 emissions

France has 56 nuclear power plants and the 4 power plants located in tricastin cover denmark's entire energy usage
