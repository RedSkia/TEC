The replacement rate 
    (imagine a bathtub that must be in balance with how much water/resources we use)


We need economics that allows us to thrive whether or not it grows

There are 5 stages of economic growth
1: traditional where the nation's output is limited by technology, institutions and mindset
2: the begining of the banking industry where the belief for economic growth is necessary for a better life
3: the interest in economic growth becomes the norm
4: the drive to have any industry no matter natural resources any 
5: the high-mass consumption phase where consumers can purchase any goods they desire


Economic growth can never go down only higher

We are addicted to economic growth

All futures includes groth no matter the choice

We dont have enough resources to bring eveyrone inside the green donut circle

We need to resycle better so the resources are never used up but used again and again
